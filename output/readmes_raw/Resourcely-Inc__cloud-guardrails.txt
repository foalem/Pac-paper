# Cloud Guardrails
There are many best practices for operating public cloud footprints effectively.

Some of these practices help with security, some help workloads be more reliable, and some are just generally good best practices.

There are various sources of best practices, including:
 - word of mouth
 - prior experience (good and bad)
 - conference talks
 - architecture whitepapers
 - benchmarks (CIS, etc.)

But it can be hard to get a high-level view quickly, see best practices in a table format, and filter to practices that are most applicable for your technology/cloud/maturity.

The Cloud Guardrails project aims to be an open-source reference of best practices to help spread knowledge and socialize what works.

Check it out at [cloudguardrails.com](https://www.cloudguardrails.com)!

## Format
Each guardrail is contained in a YAML file. We designed it this way so you can easily skim the best practices and see structured information about them. We have also built a tool to display them in a simple table format that allows sorting.

## Open source
Since the point of this project is to share knowledge, we created under the MIT license. Any future use should be shared back to the community.

## Contributing
